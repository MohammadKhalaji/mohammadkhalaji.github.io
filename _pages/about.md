I am a computer science PhD student supervised by [Prof. Trevor Brown](http://www.tbrown.pro/) in [The Multicore Lab](https://mc.uwaterloo.ca) and [Prof. Khuzaima Daudjee](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~kdaudjee/). 

My main research interests are **concurrent data structures** and **database systems**. I am currently working on persistence and versioning for fast data structures designed for multicore processors. I am currently exploring non-volatile memory and their role in achieving high-performance transactions. 

Previously, I worked on Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) and the performance profile of concurrent data structures utilizing it.
